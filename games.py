Text-Based Games Collection
==========================

This program offers two classic games:

1. Number Guessing Game:
   - Computer picks a random number between 1-100
   - Player guesses until they find it
   - Hints provided after each guess
   - Tracks number of attempts

2. Rock, Paper, Scissors:
   - Player vs Computer
   - Standard rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock
   - Score tracking for both players
   - Type 'exit' anytime to quit

How to Play:
- Run the program and choose a game from the menu
- Follow the on-screen instructions
- Type 'exit' anytime to return to main menu or quit
